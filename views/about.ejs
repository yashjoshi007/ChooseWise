        <h1>About ChooseWise</h1>
        <p>During this pandemic, all have been in constant stalemate with and are also afraid to step out due to this
            pandemic, this is a reason we are providing an AID to the hectic admission process for a parent in a
            virtual medium. So, our idea is basically to provide a platform that will compare various schools in that
            region and help people get what they exactly want. The entire admission process will be virtual so that
            they need not go for any physical meetups from school to school and can get best by sitting at their
            home.
            This idea will save time, will be less hectic for parents, will give the best for the student, will help to avoid
            physical presence at any unknown place, and will make this task easier and simpler.</p>
